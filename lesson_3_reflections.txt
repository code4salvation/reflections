When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository is a great feature made available to a programmer using git and github because a programmer might want to deploy
or share its project to several other programmers and want them to create their versions of it so that it can choose from which one
to keep. So being a programmer I feel it somehow exhibits the feature of Java's Interface but in a more improved manner. And it 
also fulfills to keep a version controlled repository on a secure server system on web where there is no fear of data loss of file
and theres always a chance to recover no matter how messy code on your local computer become.
