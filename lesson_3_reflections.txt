When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository is a great feature made available to a programmer using git and github because a programmer might want to deploy
or share its project to several other programmers and want them to create their versions of it so that it can choose from which one
to keep. So being a programmer I feel it somehow exhibits the feature of Java's Interface but in a more improved manner. And it 
also fulfills to keep a version controlled repository on a secure server system on web where there is no fear of data loss of file
and theres always a chance to recover no matter how messy code on your local computer become.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
As the Github is used for sharing of repository and files with public. People might contribute to those files and commit changes to it. You might now want those commits to be pulled automatically on your local repository as it may change the way your files are working automatically without prompting an acceptance message which would be displeasing and discomforting from a programmer's point of view.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used when you want to clone( copy along with commit history) a repository from one Github url to your Github profile within Github so it inhibits a long time taking process where you need to clone files on local computer and then push it back to your Github profile. On the other hand clones can create a clone Github repository on your local computer with all the commit history. You just need to type 
git clone Github_url_to_clone_repository_from
Branches are actually labels for commits where several commits can be starting with a branch and ending with ultimate parent. It maintains the state with a collection of commits. Where if you have a single project where you have two different logics for two different functionalities. Then you can label them under two different branches and then for your final code you can merge those branches to incorporate those functionalities in you final outcome of the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps to avoid conflicts between the local and remote repository and you can work with much more freedom and open mind on your local repository once it is in sync with remote one.
