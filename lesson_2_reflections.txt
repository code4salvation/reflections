What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialise a repository using git init, it creates a .git/ directory where you add your commits for your files and history of your will get recorded. No commit is created initially as you can check by typing git status inside that directory you created repository for. In order to create version control for your files it is essential to create repository around it so that history can be tracked inside .git/ directory inside that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
To commit a newly or previously initialised repository it is important you make sure which files you want to commit or create a newer version of in a repository so that a new version of repository is created with those updated files. To achieve this you need to add those files to a place called staging area which allows you to add those files you want to commit along with a repository, it maybe all files or even a single file in a repository. After adding these files next step is commit and you have a newer version of that repository with newer versions of files added to the staging area.
